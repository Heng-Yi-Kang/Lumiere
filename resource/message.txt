Hi [User's Name],

Just a heads-up: your task "[Task Name]" is due on [Due Date]. That’s right—time’s ticking! ⏰

If you let this slide, consequences could include:

A mildly annoyed Future You.
A sternly worded email from us.
A tiny gremlin sneaking into your dreams to remind you about it. (Okay, maybe not the gremlin. Probably.)
But you can avoid all of that by tackling it now! Got questions or need a hand? We’re here to help.

Don’t worry—you’re totally capable of making this deadline your victory lap. 🏆

Cheers,
Lumière Team
